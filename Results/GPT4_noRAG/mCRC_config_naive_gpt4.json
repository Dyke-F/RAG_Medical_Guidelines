        "response": "Comparison of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) treatment options for oligometastatic disease between ASCO and ESMO:\n\nSimilarities:\n- Surgical Resection: Both guidelines recommend surgical resection of metastases if feasible, especially in patients with limited metastatic disease (oligometastatic). This is based on several studies showing improved survival with resection of metastases (Fong et al., 1999; Choti et al., 2002).\n- Systemic Therapy: Both guidelines recommend systemic therapy before and/or after surgery. The choice of systemic therapy depends on various factors including patient's performance status, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics (ASCO, 2020; ESMO, 2020).\n- Multidisciplinary Approach: Both guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of mCRC, involving medical oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists (ASCO, 2020; ESMO, 2020).\n\nDifferences:\n- Radiotherapy: ESMO guidelines mention the use of radiotherapy (stereotactic body radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation) as an alternative to surgery in patients with oligometastatic disease who are not surgical candidates (ESMO, 2020). ASCO guidelines do not specifically mention radiotherapy in this context (ASCO, 2020).\n- Follow-up: ESMO guidelines provide specific recommendations for follow-up after treatment of oligometastatic disease, including regular imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring (ESMO, 2020). ASCO guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for follow-up in this context (ASCO, 2020).\n\nIn summary, both ASCO and ESMO guidelines recommend surgical resection and systemic therapy for the treatment of oligometastatic mCRC. However, there are some differences in the recommendations regarding the use of radiotherapy and follow-up after treatment.\n\nReferences:\n- Fong Y, Fortner J, Sun RL, Brennan MF, Blumgart LH.

(ASCO, 2020; ESMO, 2020)\n\nDifferences:\n- Second-line Therapy: ASCO recommends anti-EGFR therapy for patients who have not received it in the first-line setting, while ESMO suggests considering anti-VEGF therapy (aflibercept or ramucirumab) in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who received first-line bevacizumab. (ASCO, 2020; ESMO, 2020)\n- Clinical Trials: ESMO references the VELOUR trial, which showed improved survival with aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI in the second-line setting. ASCO does not specifically reference this trial. (ESMO, 2020)\n\nSummary: Both ASCO and ESMO guidelines show a high degree of similarity in their recommendations for the use of anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF therapies in mCRC, particularly in the first-line setting. Differences are mainly observed in the second-line setting, with ESMO suggesting the consideration of anti-VEGF therapy, while ASCO recommends anti-EGFR therapy for those who have not received it in the first-line setting.\n\nReferences:\n- American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

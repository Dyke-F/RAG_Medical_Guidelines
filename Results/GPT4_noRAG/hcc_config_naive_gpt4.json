ASCO does not provide specific guidance on this matter (ASCO, 2018).\n- Follow-up: ESMO guidelines provide more detailed recommendations on follow-up and monitoring during treatment, including specific time intervals for imaging and biomarker testing (ESMO, 2018).

        "response": "Comparison of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) treatment recommendations for BCLC B in the advanced setting between ASCO and ESMO:\n\nSimilarities:\n- Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): Both guidelines recommend TACE as a first-line treatment for patients with BCLC stage B HCC who are not suitable for curative treatments (surgery or ablation). This is based on several clinical trials showing improved survival with TACE compared to best supportive care (Llovet et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2002).\n- Systemic therapy: Both guidelines suggest systemic therapy as an alternative for patients who are not suitable for TACE or have progressed after TACE. Sorafenib is the most commonly recommended systemic therapy, based on the SHARP trial which showed improved survival with sorafenib compared to placebo (Llovet et al., 2008).\n\nDifferences:\n- TACE schedule: ESMO guidelines suggest that TACE should be repeated every 6-8 weeks until there is no viable tumor, while ASCO guidelines do not specify a schedule for TACE.\n- Second-line therapy: ASCO guidelines recommend regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab as second-line therapy after progression on sorafenib, based on the RESORCE, CELESTIAL, and REACH trials respectively (Bruix et al., 2017; Abou-Alfa et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). ESMO guidelines do not specify a preferred second-line therapy.\n\nIn summary, both ASCO and ESMO guidelines recommend TACE as first-line treatment for BCLC stage B HCC in the advanced setting, and systemic therapy for those not suitable for TACE or who have progressed after TACE. The main differences are in the schedule for TACE and the recommended second-line therapies after progression on sorafenib."

        "response": "Comparison of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) treatment recommendations for BCLC C in the advanced setting between ASCO and ESMO:\n\nSimilarities:\n- Systemic Therapy: Both ASCO and ESMO recommend systemic therapy as the primary treatment for advanced HCC (BCLC stage C). This includes the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line treatment options [1,2].\n- Clinical Trials: Both guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical trial enrollment for patients with advanced HCC, given the limited efficacy of current treatment options and the need for novel therapies [1,2].\n\nDifferences:\n- Second-line Treatment: ASCO recommends regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab (for patients with AFP \u2265400 ng/mL) as second-line treatment options after progression on sorafenib [1]. ESMO, on the other hand, recommends regorafenib or ramucirumab (for patients with AFP \u2265400 ng/mL) as second-line options, but does not mention cabozantinib [2].\n- Role of Locoregional Therapies: ESMO guidelines suggest that locoregional therapies (such as TACE or radioembolization) may be considered in selected patients with advanced HCC, even though the primary treatment is systemic therapy [2]. ASCO guidelines do not mention the use of locoregional therapies in the advanced setting [1].\n\nClinical Trials:\n- SHARP trial (sorafenib): This trial demonstrated a survival benefit with sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC, leading to its recommendation as a first-line treatment option in both ASCO and ESMO guidelines [3].\n- REFLECT trial (lenvatinib): This trial showed non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib in terms of overall survival, leading to its recommendation as a first-line treatment option in both ASCO and ESMO guidelines [4].\n- RESORCE trial (regorafenib): This trial demonstrated a survival benefit with regorafenib in patients with HCC who progressed on sorafenib, leading to its recommendation as a second-line treatment option in both ASCO and ESMO guidelines [5].\n- REACH trial (ramucirumab): This trial showed a survival benefit with ramucirumab in patients with HCC and AFP \u2265400 ng/mL who progressed on sorafenib, leading to its recommendation as a second-line treatment option in both ASCO and ESMO guidelines [6].\n\nIn summary, both ASCO and ESMO guidelines recommend systemic therapy as the primary treatment for advanced HCC (BCLC stage C), with sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line options. Differences exist in the recommended second-line treatment options and the role of locoregional therapies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

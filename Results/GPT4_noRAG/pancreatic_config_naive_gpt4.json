These techniques help in assessing the local extent of the disease and distant metastasis [1,2].\n- Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS): Both guidelines recognize the importance of EUS in providing detailed imaging of the pancreas, and its role in obtaining tissue for diagnosis [1,2].\n- Importance of Staging Laparoscopy: Both ASCO and ESMO recommend staging laparoscopy for patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced disease to rule out peritoneal or liver metastasis not detected on imaging [1,2].\n\nDifferences:\n- PET-CT Scan: ESMO guidelines suggest the use of PET-CT scan in cases where conventional imaging is inconclusive, while ASCO does not specifically mention the use of PET-CT in their guidelines [1,2].\n- Role of EUS in Staging: ESMO guidelines emphasize the role of EUS in determining vascular involvement and nodal status, while ASCO guidelines do not specifically mention these roles [1,2].\n\nSummary: Both ASCO and ESMO guidelines agree on the use of cross-sectional imaging, EUS, and staging laparoscopy in the staging of pancreatic cancer. However, there are differences in the use of PET-CT and the specific roles of EUS in staging.\n\nReferences:\n1. ASCO Guidelines on Pancreatic Cancer. American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n2.

It also includes tumors with limited arterial involvement (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2019).\n    - ESMO: Defines borderline resectable pancreatic cancer as a tumor that involves the superior mesenteric vein or portal vein by more than 180 degrees or the superior mesenteric artery or celiac axis by less than 180 degrees (European Society for Medical Oncology, 2020).\n- Neoadjuvant Therapy:\n    - ASCO: Recommends considering neoadjuvant therapy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2019).\n    - ESMO: Recommends neoadjuvant therapy for all borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients (European Society for Medical Oncology, 2020).\n\nIn summary, while both ASCO and ESMO guidelines agree on the general criteria for resectability in pancreatic cancer, they differ in their definitions of borderline resectable disease and their recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nReferences:\n- National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

        "response": "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time databases or guidelines to provide a line-by-line comparison of the ESMO and ASCO guidelines on metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, I can provide a general comparison based on the information I was trained on.\n\nComparison of metastatic pancreatic cancer treatment recommendations between ASCO and ESMO:\n\nSimilarities:\n- Both guidelines recommend systemic chemotherapy as the primary treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n- Both guidelines suggest FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment options for patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1).\n- Both guidelines recommend gemcitabine monotherapy or best supportive care for patients with poor performance status (ECOG 2 or higher).\n- Both guidelines suggest second-line treatment with either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (whichever was not used first-line) for patients with good performance status, or gemcitabine monotherapy for those with poor performance status.\n\nDifferences:\n- The ESMO guidelines may suggest more specific criteria for patient selection for FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, based on factors such as age, comorbidities, and patient preference.\n- The ASCO guidelines may provide more detailed recommendations on the management of treatment-related toxicities.\n\nClinical trials:\n- The PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial demonstrated the superiority of FOLFIRINOX over gemcitabine in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good performance status.\n- The MPACT trial showed that gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel improved overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone in a similar patient population.\n\nIn summary, both the ESMO and ASCO guidelines recommend similar treatment strategies for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of first-line treatment largely dependent on the patient's performance status. However, there may be some differences in the specifics of patient selection and toxicity management."

ASCO guidelines do not mention this (ESMO, 2020; ASCO, 2019).\n\nSummary:\nBoth ASCO and ESMO guidelines recommend the use of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer, based on the PA.3 trial. Other targeted therapies are not routinely recommended by either guideline due to lack of evidence of survival benefit. However, ESMO guidelines mention the potential use of olaparib as maintenance therapy in a specific subset of patients, based on the POLO trial.\n\nReferences:\n- ASCO. (2019).
